
Transcendental Meditation Routine

•	0:00–1:00: Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your hands resting on your lap.
    Close your eyes gently and take three slow, deep breaths to settle your mind and body.

•	1:00–4:00: Silently begin repeating a chosen mantra in your mind. A mantra can be a word, sound, or phrase that feels calming to you (e.g., “Om” or “Peace”).
Avoid forcing the repetition. Let it flow naturally and rhythmically.

•	4:00–8:00: Gradually shift your focus entirely to the mantra, letting go of other thoughts.
If your mind wanders, gently guide it back to the mantra without judgment.

•	8:00–9:00: Allow the mantra to fade naturally from your focus.
Sit quietly and let your mind rest, observing any residual sensations of peace.

•	9:00–10:00: Slowly bring awareness back to your surroundings.
Take a few deep breaths, stretch your arms or neck gently, and open your eyes when ready.


Breath Awareness Meditation

•	0:00–2:00: Sit comfortably with your back straight. Close your eyes and relax. Take deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of air moving through your nose.

•	2:00–5:00: Breathe naturally. Focus on your breath's rhythm—inhale and exhale. If thoughts arise, gently bring your attention back to the breath.

•	5:00–8:00: Begin counting your breaths: inhale (1), exhale (2), up to 10. Start again if your mind wanders.

•	8:00–10:00: Let go of counting. Simply enjoy the calm of mindful breathing. Slowly open your eyes and stretch if needed.

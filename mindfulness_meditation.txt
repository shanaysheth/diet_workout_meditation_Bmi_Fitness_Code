•	0:00–2:00: Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take deep breaths. Feel a sense of warmth and relaxation spreading through your body.

•	2:00–4:00: Focus on yourself. Silently repeat phrases like: “May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be at peace.” Feel these intentions deeply.

•	4:00–6:00: Think of someone you care about. Repeat: “May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be at peace.” Visualize their happiness.

•	6:00–8:00: Expand your focus to others—friends, strangers, or even difficult people. Send them the same wishes.

•	8:00–10:00: End by wishing well to all living beings. Reflect on the warmth you feel and open your eyes gently.

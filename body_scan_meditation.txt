
Body Scan Meditation

•	0:00–1:00: Lie down or sit in a relaxed position. Close your eyes and take slow, deep breaths.

•	1:00–3:00: Focus on your toes. Notice any sensations—tingling, warmth, or tension. Then consciously relax them.

•	3:00–5:00: Gradually move your focus upward: feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs. Notice and relax each area.

•	5:00–8:00: Continue scanning upward: pelvis, stomach, chest, shoulders, arms, neck, and head. Take your time with each area.

•	8:00–10:00: Scan your whole body as one. Feel relaxed and grounded. Take a deep breath, stretch slightly, and open your eyes.
